I am an assistant professor in CSE and lead a research group on building social and collaborative systems."

			"text": "Content moderation isn&rsquo;t just removing bad stuff, though that&rsquo;s part of it, and it's the part that you've probably heard about the most. The first thing is to remember that content moderation has been with us as long as we&rsquo;ve had content, or media of any kind. A long time ago, journalists and TV and radio producers had editors and regulators that looked over their work and made decisions about what would get published or broadcasted. At that time, there weren&rsquo;t very many avenues for media consumption so these so called \"gatekeepers\" had a lot of editorial control over what people saw, and as a result we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of diversity at the time in media. Of course this whole thing has turned on its head thanks to social media."

			"text": "And a lot of what social media has changed has been great. As I mentioned there has been more diversity in what&rsquo;s out there in terms of elevating minority voices. And for a long time there was this really positive, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re doing good for society&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re bringing the world together&rdquo; kind of feeling about social media back in the early to mid 2000&rsquo;s. See these two quotes from around that time. It&rsquo;s kind of eye-opening to read these rosy quotes today, knowing the sentiment around social media now!"

			"text": "And of course it&rsquo;s not the case that everything was great, and then everything went terrible. Even back then, there were lots of people, in particular marginalized groups like women in gaming, that were experiencing horrible issues of harassment, stalking, doxing, nonconsensual sexual imagery in online spaces and yelling about it to all of these platforms and were basically ignored for a long time. But it&rsquo;s really starting to become more recognized in the mainstream more recently, and it's a problem that platforms are taking more seriously in the last several years after a number of incidents that have happened and a lot of public scrutiny."
