			"abstract": "We present a novel method for classifying comments in online discussions into a set of coarse discourse acts towards the goal of better understanding discussions at scale. We collect and release a corpus of over 9,000 threads comprising over 100,000 comments. We demonstrate how the analysis of discourse acts can characterize different types of discussions. Finally, we conduct experiments finding that structured prediction models such as conditional random fields can achieve an F1 score of 75%.",

			"abstract": "In this article, we describe a workflow called <em>recursive summarization</em>, implemented in our&nbsp;<em>Wikum</em>&nbsp;prototype, that enables a large population of readers or editors to work in small doses to refine out the main points of the discussion. More than just a single summary, our workflow produces a&nbsp;<em>summary tree</em>&nbsp;that enables a reader to explore distinct subtopics at multiple levels of detail based on their interests.",
