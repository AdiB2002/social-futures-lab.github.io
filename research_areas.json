But these designs bake in many assumptions about discussion that limit our capabilities for collaboration and that also lead to problems. How can we design new mediums for online discourse that make it easier to listen, share, and create?</span>",

We design democratic structures to support community resilience as well as tools for self-governance.</span><br />",
