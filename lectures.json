			"description": "We created different learning and activity modules that revolve around different subtopics within social computing, including data management, online behavior, encryption, misinformation, machine learning and bias, and HCI careers. These materials were designed specifically for middle school and high school students. We have deployed these materials in local middle school and high school classrooms and after-school clubs in the greater Seattle area and have also used them in training materials for K12 educators."
