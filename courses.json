			"quarter": "Winter 2022",
			"description": "<span style=\"color: #111111; font-family: Assistant, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">In this capstone course, senior undergraduate students work in groups to apply software engineering and system design skills they have learned over their four years in computer science towards building a novel social computing system to address a social challenge. We follow a human-centered design process for groups to ideate, prototype, test, implement, and showcase their novel system. Along the way, students will gain a broad understanding of the current major pressing issues and state of the art of knowledge in social computing, while taking a critical lens toward social computing systems they use every day. Along with the capstone project, we have readings, group discussions, reflections, and guest speakers working in social computing.</span>"

			"title": "CSE 599: Social and Collaborative Computing",
			"quarter": "Spring 2021",
			"description": "In this seminar course, students gain a broad understanding of the current research landscape in social computing, focusing on a system design perspective to examine and imagine new designs to address pressing issues. We will read and discuss papers weekly covering different subareas of social computing, foundational papers in the field, and different methods in social computing. Finally, all students individually or in groups will conduct a research project on building, evaluating, or theorizing about a new social computing design."
